# Medical Diagnosis Using AI  

This project aims to develop an AI-based system for predicting and diagnosing diseases such as heart disease, lung cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and thyroid disorders. The system leverages machine learning techniques and provides an interactive **Streamlit** web application for easy accessibility.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- AI-powered disease prediction using machine learning models  
- Interactive **Streamlit** web interface for user input  
- Supports heart disease, lung cancer, Parkinsonâ€™s disease, and thyroid disorders  
- Deployable on **Streamlit Cloud, AWS, or Heroku**  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Streamlit** (Frontend)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)
